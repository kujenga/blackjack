# Blackjack
#### Created by Aaron Taylor

A command line game implemented in Ruby

## How to play
The program prompts the player for the necessary actions each hand, asking for initial bets and then presenting the standard options of hit, stand, double, split, and surrender.

Aces are handled by defaulting to a high value, and if the player goes over they are used as low.
